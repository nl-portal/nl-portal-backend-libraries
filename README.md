## NL Portal

NL Portal is an application for communicating with citizens and third parties. It is built for use with the Dutch 
'VNG APIâ€™s for Zaakgericht Werken' - though not required. The development is based on Common Ground principles. Under 
the motto 'create once, use 340 times', the NL Portal has been built open source, so any (government) organization can 
use and improve it without restrictions.

Starting principles are:
- Open standards, open source under EUPL 1.2;
- Frontend UI based on NL Design System;
- Independent of process- or case management systems;
- Horizontal scalable;
- A-sync communication with other services.
