## NL Portal

NL Portal is an application for communicating with citizens and third parties. It is built for use with the Dutch 
'VNG APIâ€™s for Zaakgericht Werken' - though not required. The development is based on Common Ground principles. Under 
the motto 'create once, use 340 times', the NL Portal has been built open source, so any (government) organization can 
use and improve it without restrictions.

Starting principles are:
- Open standards, open source under EUPL 1.2;
- Frontend UI based on NL Design System;
- Independent of process- or case management systems;
- Horizontal scalable;
- A-sync communication with other services.

## Getting started
* Before starting this project you need to clone `https://github.com/nl-portal/nl-portal-docker-compose` and run the following command in that repository: `docker compose up -d`.
    * When supporting ZGW services are needed, like Open Zaak, Objects API and Objecttypes API, the following command should be used: `docker compose --profile zgw up -d`
* Then run the Gradle `bootRun` task: `./gradlew app:bootRun` in the nl-portal-backend-libraries project


## Known issues
Intellij on MacOs has a known issue in which docker containers for testing fail to startup and subsequently those tests fail.
``
Cannot run program "docker" (in directory "/Users/user/Documents/nl-portal/nl-portal-backend-libraries/case"): error=2, 
No such file or directory
``
This occurs when starting intellij from the JetBrains toolbox or using the MacOs UI and subsequently starting the build using the build in GradleWrapper 
As a workaround start intellij from the terminal for example by using the command
``open -a "IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate"``
or run the gradle command from terminal
